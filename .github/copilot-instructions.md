## Angular instructions

- Use the inject method istead of a constructor for dependency injection.
- Make use of signals where possible.
- Always use the Control Flow instead of ngIf and ngFor.
- Use signal inputs and outputs instead of @Input and @Output.
- Don't add standalone: true to the decorators, this is enabled by default.
- Import rxjs operators from 'rxjs' instead of 'rxjs/operators'.
- Prefer template driven forms over reactive forms.
- Use the async pipe instead of subscribing to observables in the component.
- Use the latest Angular features and best practices, currently Angular 19.
- Use nx CLI for project setup and management.
- Follow the Angular style guide for consistent code structure.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better tooling support.
- Make use of Angular standalone components.
- Angular component should have a maximum of 200 lines of code.
- Use **services** for http requests and **@ngrx/signals** store for data management.
- Use **RxJS** for handling asynchronous operations and event streams.
- Use **tailwind** CSS for styling.
- Use **Spartan Ng** (https://www.spartan.ng) UI components.
- The website is in darkmode only, make sure all the components are styled accordingly in dark mode.
- Provide more modern UI components.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met for all UI components.
